Description: Recalibrate risk scores (predicting binary outcomes) to improve clinical utility of risk score using weighted logistic or constrained logistic recalibration methods. Additionally, produces plots to assess the potential for recalibration to improve the clinical utility of a risk model. Methods are described in detail in Mishra, A.
